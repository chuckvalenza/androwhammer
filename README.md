**AndRowhammer**

This is attempt to implement the
[rowhammer test](https://github.com/google/rowhammer-test) on an android device.
If this is the case, then it may be possible to get remote execution on current
generation android devices with the exploit. If this is the case, the next step
would be to implement priviledge escalation as performed in Google's
[Project Zero](http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/).
