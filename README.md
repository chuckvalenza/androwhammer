AndRowhammer

This is attempt to implement the rowhammer test can be implemented on an
android device. If this is the case, then it may be possible to get remote
execution on current generation android devices with the exploit. If this
is the case, the next step would be to implement priviledge escalation as
performed in Google's Project Zero.
